CrowdAI team name: LaVolpeilFioreEilColosso

The files are organised based on 
+ the process followed to implement the models;
+ the machine learning algorithms being applied.

The files created and the functions developed are presented in the following sections:

* [Preprocessing](#prepr)
* [Logistic Regression](#logistic)
* [Ridge Regression](#ridge)
* [Neural Nets](#cnn)
* [Post Processing](#pp)
